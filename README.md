# apache-beam-examples

The purpose of this repository is to provide examples of common Apache Beam functionality and unit tests. In my time
writing Apache Beam code, I have found it very difficult to find example code online to help with understand how to use
parts of the SDK. Documentation on the Beam unit testing framework (PAssert) is even harder to come by. This is why I have written the
following two articles to help people get started with writing and testing both batch and streaming pipeline in Beam
